		<p id="welcome">Welcome to the SCRUMBAGS TEAM WEBSITE!<br /><br /> The four of us come from different backgrounds, and we each have different interests and goals. But one way or another our individual journeys led all of us here – to Boise State University's Games, Interactive Media, and Mobile technology program. Our hope is that this site will help visitors get to know each of us a little better.<br /><br /> We like to think of the GIMM program not just as a collection of shared classes, but as one great big family...</p>
