		<p id="welcome">Welcome to the SCRUMBAGS TEAM WEBSITE!<br /><br /> The four of us come from different backgrounds, and we each have different interests and goals. But one way or another our individual journeys led all of us here – to Boise State University's Games, Interactive Media, and Mobile technology program. Our hope is that this site will help visitors get to know each of us a little better.<br /><br /> We like to think of the GIMM program not just as a collection of shared classes, but as one great big family...</p>

In my current classes im learning more to code in C#, PHP, HTML, and Swift for IOS. I’m learning and continuing to develop my skills for game building, animation, website creation and much more. My personal hobbies are gaming, fishing, rock hunting, camping, hiking, tennis, and playing around with my applications and projects that I’m currently working on.</p>
