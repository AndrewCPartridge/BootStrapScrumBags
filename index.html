I’m learning and continuing to develop my skills in coding for game building, animation, website creation and much more.

<p class="text-left col-xl-4">Male. 21 years old. I moved here from Washington state last year to start learning about the things I am passionate about. GIMM has given me the opportunity to explore every facet of game design at once—programming, art and animation, sound design, and so on. Since starting this program, I have become well-versed in Microsoft Office and the Adobe CC Suite. I am in the process of learning to program in C#, HTML, and other languages. In my spare time I enjoy singing, writing, gaming, and hiking. </p>
