okay, so i've made a new branch, because i guess we're each supposed to have out own branch for this assignment. also, i've made some changes to the website that i feel like need approval before i actually push them, because they affect some changes that another group member made.

i personally felt like the custom cursor was a bit gimicky, so i restricted it to only change the user's cursor when they hover over specific elements. i also fixed the picture flipping to look more clean.

these changes reflect my personal preferences, but this is a democracy, so i'm not going to push them to the master branch. if you guys could look them over and tell me what you think, that would be awesome.

additionally, i am deleting the internal folder in this branch, because it is confusing and github is having trouble figuring out where it's supposed to upload files.
